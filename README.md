### About:
- I wanted to test my ability to create an application with a responsive SwiftUI interface that would format and display data pulled from a JSON file. GhibliLog is an application that displays a catalogue of movies that can be browsed along with a detailView with relevant details for each film like a bio and an inset gallery view. 


### Resources:
- GhibliLog uses JSON data pulled from the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com)
- Ghiblilog is created in Swift leveraging the SwiftUI and Foundation Libraries
